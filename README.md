# Music Genre Classification
In the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Music Genre Classification plays a crucial role. The [GTZAN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) dataset, often regarded as the "MNIST of audio," consists of 1,000 music tracks categorized into 10 different genres, from Blues to Rock. Each music track is 30 seconds long and is accompanied by visual representation and extracted feature data.
